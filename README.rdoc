# dc-update-web
Web interface for updating docker containments (see dc-update project)

It requires:
- dc-update to be in the path
- a .dockercfg file under the user home directory of the user who runs the rails app

How it works:
- add your images throught the web interface
- run "rake dc_update:run" on a crontab
